DAY-1

🔹 Programming Question: Print Fibonacci Series up to N Terms

💡 Problem Statement:

Write a program to generate and print the Fibonacci series up to n terms, where n is a positive integer input by the user.


---

🧾 Input:

A single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), denoting the number of terms to print.



---

📤 Output:

Print the Fibonacci series up to n terms on a single line.

Each term should be separated by a space.



---

🧪 Sample Input 1:

5

✅ Sample Output 1:

0 1 1 2 3


---

🧪 Sample Input 2:

10

✅ Sample Output 2:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34


---

📝 Constraints:

Use iteration (not recursion) for better performance with large n.

Input validation is optional.


DAY-2

Programming Question:

Create a program that prints all the integers from 1 to 100, each on a new line, without using any loop constructs. You are not allowed to use for, while, do-while, or any equivalent looping mechanism in your chosen programming language. Additionally, you must not use any built-in functions or libraries that perform iteration internally to generate the sequence. The output must be in ascending order, starting from 1 and ending at 100.
